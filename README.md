Hi, I'm Rinav Gangar!

I am leading a team of 8 talented developers at [Agrahyah Technologies Pvt Ltd](https://agrahyah.com) where I am leading development of [aawaz app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aawaz). Apart from android and Kotlin I love exploring Linux.

With over 9+ years of enterprise in software and mobile development working with a broad range of industries including Audio, News Media, Banking & Mutual Funds and IOT.

My curiosity for android os and Java made me root my first android phone; Samsung Galaxy Note 1 - GT7000. It was massive in size with a magical pen. Rooting and flashing custom ROM was the magical moment when I decided to get into android development.

But what really pushed me into android was the announcement of Android Studio on IntelliJ as I hated eclipse to it's core. I have used every release of android studio, all the canary's and betas.

With more than **six** years of Android development experience, I have learned valuable lessons on software and product development.

In a previous life I used to write code for server-side enterprise Java applications.

When I am not developing apps I like to read on Kindle or take a ride on my bike.

If you want to discuss anything or have any questions, please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_rinav), I am always happy to discuss things!
