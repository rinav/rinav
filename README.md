# Hi there, I'm Rinav Gangar! 👋

### 📱 Senior Android Engineer | 14+ Years Experience
**Remote Native | Startup to Enterprise Scale**

I've been building on Android since the days of Froyo. Over the last **14 years**, I've navigated the chaotic early stages of startups and engineered robust solutions for massive **US-based e-commerce organizations**. 

Currently, I am **open to new opportunities** (Remote/Hybrid) where I can bring stability, scalability, and clean code to your mobile team.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Arsenal
* **Languages:** Kotlin (Primary), Java (Legacy expert)
* **UI:** Jetpack Compose, XML
* **Architecture:** Clean Architecture, MVVM, MVI, Modularization
* **Async:** Coroutines, Flow, RxJava
* **DI & Net:** Hilt, Dagger 2, Koin, Retrofit
* **Tools:** Gradle, CI/CD (Azure DevOps), Firebase, JUnit

### 📖 The Origin Story, why Android?
My curiosity for Linux and Java made me root my first Android phone, the **Samsung Galaxy Note 1**. That massive device with the magical pen changed everything for me. Rooting and flashing custom ROMs was the spark.

But the fire really started with the announcement of **Android Studio**. I despised Eclipse. When IntelliJ/Android Studio arrived, I dove all in. Since then, I've used every release, from the earliest Canaries to the latest Stable builds.

### 💼 What I Bring to the Table
* **Scale:** Experience handling apps with millions of active users.
* **Remote Fluency:** Years of experience working asynchronously with US teams.
* **Leadership:** Mentoring juniors, and making architectural decisions.

---

### ⚡ Outside of Code
When I'm not fighting Gradle build times, you can find me:
* **Reader:** Always have my Kindle nearby.
* **Rider:** Motorcycling is my meditation.
* **Linux Enthusiast:** I still love exploring the OS that powers it all.
