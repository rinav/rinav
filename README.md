### 📱 Senior Android Engineer | 14+ Years Experience
**Remote Native | Startup to Enterprise Scale**

Currently, I am **open to new opportunities** (Remote/Hybrid) where I can bring stability, scalability, and clean code to your mobile team.

### 📖 The Origin Story, why Android?
My curiosity for Linux and Java made me root my first Android phone, the **Samsung Galaxy Note 1**. That massive device with the magical pen changed everything for me. Rooting and flashing custom ROMs was the spark.

But the fire really started with the announcement of **Android Studio**. I despised Eclipse. When IntelliJ/Android Studio arrived, I dove all in. Since then, I've used every release, from the earliest Canaries to the latest Stable builds.

### 💼 What I Bring to the Table
* **Scale:** Experience handling apps with millions of active users.
* **Remote Fluency:** Years of experience working asynchronously with US teams.
* **Leadership:** Mentoring juniors, and making architectural decisions.

### ⚡ Outside of Code
When I'm not fighting Gradle build times, you can find me:When I'm not fighting Gradle build times, you can find me:
* 🏍️ **Riding:** Motorcycling is my meditation on wheels.
* 🎮 **Gaming:** I unwind and blow off steam on my **PS5**.
* 🧘‍♂️ **Finding Peace:** For mental clarity, I visit the temple or spend time in quiet spiritual reflection.
* 📚 **Reading:** Always have my Kindle nearby or something to Read.
